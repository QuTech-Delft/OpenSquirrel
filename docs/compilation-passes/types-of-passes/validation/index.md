The _Validator_ passes in _OpenSquirrel_ are meant to provide some tools to check whether a quantum circuit is
executable given the restraints imposed by the hardware. OpenSquirrel facilitates the following validation passes:

- [Routing validator](routing-validator.md)

- [Primitive gate validator](primitive-gate-validator.md)
