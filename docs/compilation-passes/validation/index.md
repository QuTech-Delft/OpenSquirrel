Validator passes in OpenSquirrel are meant to provide some tools to check whether a quantum circuit is
executable given the constraints imposed by the target backend.
OpenSquirrel facilitates the following validation passes:

- [Interaction validator](interaction-validator.md) (`InteractionValidator`)
- [Primitive gate validator](primitive-gate-validator.md) (`PrimitiveGateValidator`)
