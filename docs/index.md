This site contains the documentation for OpenSquirrel, _i.e._, a flexible quantum program compiler.
OpenSquirrel chooses a _modular_, over a _configurable_, approach to prepare and optimize quantum circuits for heterogeneous target architectures.

It has a user-friendly interface and is straightforwardly extensible with custom-made readers, compiler passes, and exporters.
As a quantum circuit compiler, it is fully aware of the semantics of each gate and arbitrary quantum gates can be constructed manually.
It understands the quantum programming language cQASM 3 and will support additional quantum programming languages in the future.
It is developed in modern Python and follows best practices.
