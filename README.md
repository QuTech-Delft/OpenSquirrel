# Installation

`pip install opensquirrel`

# Documentation

The package exposes only the `Circuit` class, whose up-to-date documentation is accessed:

- from the Python console:
```pycon
>>> import opensquirrel
>>> help(opensquirrel.Circuit)
```

- from a Linux shell: `python3 -c "import opensquirrel; help(opensquirrel.Circuit)"`

Currently there is also a set of default gates exposed as `opensquirrel.DefaultGates` to use in the `Circuit` constructor.
