The documentation for the code can be found in various Jupyter notebooks located in the `tutorials` folder.

`Jupyter` and `sympy` are required to access the notebooks. These can be installed all at once by running.

```
pip install opensquirrel[examples]
```

Alternatively, one can install both packages manually. Installing `Jupyter` using pip can be done by executing,

```
pip install jupyter
```

and `sympy`,

```
pip install sympy
```

To open the `Jupyter` notebooks, one can run,

```
jupyter notebook
```

in the `example/tutorials` folder.
