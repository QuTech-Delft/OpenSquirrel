The documentation for the code can be found in various Jupyter notebooks located in the `tutorials` folder.

`Jupyter` and `sympy` are required to access the notebooks. These can be installed all at once by running:

```shell
$ pip install opensquirrel[examples]
```

Alternatively, one can install both packages manually:

```shell
$ pip install jupyter sympy
```

To open the `Jupyter` notebooks, one can run

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

in the `example/tutorials` folder.
